# React Portfolio Website (Version 1)

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first attempt at crafting a portfolio website using the Next.js framework in React and Tailwind. The older version written in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript was mainly helpful for learning and practising the basics. However, to start learning in preparation for modern full-stack projects, I figured it was time for an upgrade.

Cheers to learning and building cool stuff! ðŸš€

I'll probably update this README when I have more experience in writing proper markdown docs and when I eventually update the website.

To run this project on your local machine,
```bash
npm run dev
```

Cheers!
